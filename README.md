# Concerning the Yoga-Poses-Prediction-Project
# Objective:
Developing a deep learning model to predict and classify yoga poses from images, aiming to enhance practitioners' ability to improve their posture and technique.

# Overview:
Yoga practitioners often seek guidance on the correctness of their poses for optimal benefits. This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to create a model capable of accurately predicting and classifying various yoga poses based on images. The goal is to provide practitioners with real-time feedback, enabling them to refine their postures, enhance technique, and derive maximum benefits from their yoga practice. 

# Relevance:

*Improved Technique: Practitioners can refine their yoga poses by receiving instant feedback on alignment and technique, fostering continuous improvement.

*Injury Prevention: Accurate pose predictions contribute to injury prevention by guiding practitioners away from incorrect postures that may lead to strain or injury.

*Accessible Guidance: The model provides accessible guidance for yoga enthusiasts, including those who may not have immediate access to in-person instructors.

*Personalized Practice: Tailored feedback and progress tracking facilitate a personalized yoga practice, accommodating individual abilities and goals.
